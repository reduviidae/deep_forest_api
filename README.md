# To See Chat App

Please review the demo-local branch to see the working version of the simple chat and draw feature.

To run the backend will require several steps:
- Open three tabs in your terminal in the same directory. 
- In one tab, run 'rails s'
- In another tab, run 'bundle exec anycable'
- In your third tab, run 'anycable-go --host=localhost --port=3334'

This will provide the backend API as well as the websockets connection. Please see the AnyCable documentation for further help: https://docs.anycable.io/#/using_with_rails

Once the backend is up and running, you can start the client: https://github.com/reduviidae/deep_forest_client
